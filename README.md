# What The Weather
What the weather is a simple app to check the weather in different cities or countries. It uses the [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers) APIs.

## Why
I created this to have a project to practice what I've learned about git pull, push, merge and branching.
